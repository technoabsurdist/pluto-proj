# Minting an NFT on the Terra Blockchain

NFTs have been generating a lot of buzz in the blockchain community for some time now, particularly in the digital art space. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that may be showcased and bought/sold on the blockchain. Purchasing an NFT gives you ownership over the unique digital creation, somewhat similar to buying a distinct painting or art piece.

In this tutorial, we will go over how you may transfer your digital art to the blockchain, minting your own NFT. Transfering your NFT to the Terra blockchain allows for exposure to millions of users who utilize the Terra ecosystem worldwide.

If you would like to view available collections that are on sale on the Terra blockchain, you may navigate to [randomearth marketplace](https://randomearth.io/collections).

## Getting Started

These instructions assume that you have already set up a Terra Station wallet in order to interact with the Terra blockchain. You may create a new wallet on the [Terra Station extension](https://docs.terra.money/docs/learn/terra-station/download/terra-station-extension.html) on Google Chrome which you will need to install in order to confirm transactions on the application.

You will also need to install [LocalTerra](https://github.com/terra-money/LocalTerra), a Terra blockchain and ecosystem which runs on your personal computer for testing, and [Terrain](https://github.com/terra-money/terrain), a Terra development environment for smart contract development. Be sure to follow the instructions to install all necessary dependencies for both LocalTerra as well as Terrain and ensure that they execute properly on your system.

After installing the above dependencies, you may clone this repository, which contains the smart contract with NFT minting functionality as well as the corresponding front-end application, to the directory of your choice utilizing the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/terran6/nft-on-terra.git
```

Change directory into the cloned repository and run the command `npm install` in your terminal to install all relevant Node dependencies. If you have not installed npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer, you may find instructions on how to do so based on your operating system [here](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/).
